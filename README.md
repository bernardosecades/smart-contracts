[![CI Tests](https://github.com/bernardosecades/smart-contracts/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bernardosecades/smart-contracts/actions/workflows/test.yml) [![CI Linter](https://github.com/bernardosecades/smart-contracts/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bernardosecades/smart-contracts/actions/workflows/linter.yml)

To learn smart contracts, test for those contracts, and a script that deploys those contracts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

Makefile

```shell
make help
```
